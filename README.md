# Introduction
# GLOBAL-INSIGHT-ANALYTICS
Global Insights Analytics is a consultancy specializing in  demographic research and data- driven insights to help governments,  NGOs, and businesses understand global population trends.
# 1.1 Overview
This report presents a comprehensive global demographic analysis, illustrating how the world population has evolved over time, how it is geographically distributed today, and how it is segmented by major religious affiliations. The structure of the report allows the reader to develop an understanding of long-term trends, present-day population concentration, and underlying cultural composition. Power BI has been used to extract data directly from online sources, enabling automation, periodic refresh, and continuous accuracy as global data updates. The design and analytical flow position the report as both a reference tool and a dashboard for ongoing monitoring.
